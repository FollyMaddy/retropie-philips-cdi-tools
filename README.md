You can use this script if you use an old version of lr-mess !

Due to changes in the new lr-mess this will not work anymore !

Try this to get it working again :

# retropie-philips-cdi-tools

I have added 2 programs.

Dependencies for both scripts : 

These programs only works if RetroPie is installed on your computer.

Lr-mess has to be installed by the RetroPie-setup before using the scripts!

Lr-mess is installable trough the experimental packages as source ! (3,5 hours for compilation is not unusual)

After compilation mess_libretro.so is in /opt/retropie/libretrocores/lr-mess 

Emulationstation is set to use this rom-map for lr-mess : /home/pi/RetroPie/roms/arcadia

Also make sure you have installed the desired python-modules if you want to use Retropie_Philips_CD-I_gamelist_creator.py

(sudo apt-get install python-tk)

# retropie_philips_cdi_setup.sh

Use :

This script is made to make it possible to run Philips_CD-I "*.chd" images in lr-mess through libretro-retroarch in RetroPie

It will set up the map structure to get philips cdi working in retropie with lr-mess

Philips_CD-I works on RPI-3 but is not very fast. 

Philips_CD-I works best on RPI-4 or an X86 computer. 


Notes :

VCD-video/DVC-video and VCD-games/DVC-games do not work ;

Extra info about creating .chd files and mouse settings (if possible) are in the script.

So carefully read the script !

added in 2020 Version :

*full-screen

*full mouse support and fixes are implemented

*joystick button associations for keyboard, mouse and eventually joystick

*creation of short-name files necessary to load cd-i .chd files

*short-named files contain info about the .chd files to be created (open as textfile)

*User Interface of lr-mess is turned off for Philips_CD-I


ps.

In addition, just using "mess" is also an option, but is too slow on Raspberry pi.

Perhaps raspberry pi 4 will do but is not tested for now.

After the last update all is working fine with lr-mess, so there is no need to make a script for mess.


# Retropie_Philips_CD-I_gamelist_creator.py

Use :

Create Philips_CD-I gamelist.xml for Retropie from cdi.xml of lr-mame/lr-mess.

When you use lr-mess for running Philips_CD-I you make use of shortnamed link files.

This script converts the "good info" of cdi.xml from lr-mame/lr-mess to a useful retropie gamelist.xml.

For now, only the "shortnames with path" and the "longnames discriptions" are converted. 

You can read the script to find out more.
